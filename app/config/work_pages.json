The company was started by a number of former Kiddicare employees, including the original CEO and Kiddicare founder.</p><p>The project was divided into two parts: coding the responsive design administration area and creating the JavaScript which will be used as a third-party script on the retailers' websites.</p><p>The code for the third-party JavaScript had to work across the full spectrum of devices and browsers, including Internet Explorer 6 and up and all Android major versions. For performance reasons, the code had to be standalone without the support of a library like jQuery. It's role was to communicate from the retailers' sites, injecting HTML in return when required.</p><p>The administration area used a number of JavaScript libraries including velocity.js for animation, pmrpc.js for cross-domain iFrame communication and moment.js for consistent date formatting.</p>",

At the initial usability tests in November 2013, the website was over 3mb in size and took 22 seconds to load on the Tesco Hudle Android tablet.
